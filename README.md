# ReadMe Notes

## Runnig the code
I would suggest that you simply source the analysis.Rmd file and run it in R Studio or simply compile with use of the knitr. I'm using in-line code interpretation to highlight the findings but if you insists presumably you can run just the R code as it has some comments that should make it clear.

### Data
The code will look if the zip archive or CSV is available in the current  directory, if it isn't it will try to download the required file.
