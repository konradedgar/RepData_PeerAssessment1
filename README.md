# ReadMe Notes

## Runnig the code
I would suggest that you simply source the analysis.Rmd file and run it in R Studio or simply compile with use of the knitr. I'm using in-line code interpretation to highlight the findings but if you insists presumably you can run just the R code as it has some comments that should make it clear.

### Final files
* **PA1_template.Rmd** - the file contains the final markdown file in the Rmd format
* **PA1_template.hml** - contains the HTML output generated by knit
* **PA1_template.md** - the file contains the MD output generated by knit
* **README.md** - the file you are currently reading


### Data
The code will look if the zip archive or CSV is available in the current  directory, if it isn't it will try to download the required file. The CSV file is available in the repo.
